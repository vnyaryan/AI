Script Logic:
1. Import necessary modules from the langchain library for interacting with OpenAI's models.
2. Securely manage the API key and initialize the OpenAI class with it.
3. Define a prompt template for generating code based on input variables (programming language and task).
4. Chain the prompt template and the model together using the pipe operator to create a sequence of operations.
5. Generate a code snippet by invoking the chain with specific inputs (language and task).
6. Print the generated code snippet to the console.
